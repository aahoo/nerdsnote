# NerdsNote

A simple and elegant notebook for nerds!

This app is built using [Web Starter Kit](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit). Checkout their website for the development process.

There is a minor difference in the gulpfile. `serve:dist` task is renamed to `s` and it has change watches like `serve` task. So use `gulp` for building and `gulp s` for building + serving + developing.

Read [here](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp/blob/master/docs/recipes/gh-pages.md) for deployment to Github pages.
